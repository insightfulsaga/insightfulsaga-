# Databricks Workspace UI Tour — All Menus & Features

Imagine logging into Databricks for the very first time.

You’re the newly hired data engineer at **ShopWave**, and today is your first day using the platform.  
Your lead engineer leans over and says:

> **“Let’s take a quick tour. Databricks is huge, but you’ll love how everything connects.”**

You take a deep breath.  
The Workspace loads.  
And your journey begins.

---

## 🖥️ The Databricks Home Screen

When the Workspace opens, you’ll see:

- A **left navigation sidebar**
- A **main content area**
- A **top bar** with search, settings, profile, and notifications

Let’s explore each part, just like your lead engineer would walk you through it.

---

## 📚 Sidebar Overview — The Heart of Navigation

The sidebar is where you’ll find almost everything you need: notebooks, workflows, clusters, data, and more.

Here’s each item explained **as a story** through ShopWave’s workflow.

---

### 1. **Workspace**

Your lead engineer clicks **Workspace**, saying:

> “This is where notebooks, folders, and shared projects live.”

Inside Workspace, you’ll find:
- Your personal folder  
- Team folders  
- Repos (Git-based projects)  
- Shared resources  
- ML and analytics notebooks  

ShopWave uses this area to keep projects organized by **team → product → workflow**.

---

### 2. **Repos**

Repos connect Databricks to Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps).

Your ML teammate explains:

> “Every notebook we deploy to production starts here.”

With Repos, teams can:
- Version notebooks  
- Commit code  
- Run CI/CD  
- Collaborate like software engineers  

---

### 3. **Workspace Browser / Home**

Your “Home” folder is your personal sandbox where you create:
- Notebooks  
- Experiments  
- Files  
- Scratch work  

ShopWave developers use Home as their private playground before publishing work to shared repos.

---

### 4. **Data**

Your analyst clicks **Data** and says:

> “This is where we explore everything inside the Lakehouse.”

In the Data tab, you can:
- Browse databases  
- Inspect Delta tables  
- View schemas and sample data  
- Manage catalogs (Unity Catalog)  
- Query data directly  

For ShopWave, all sales, orders, inventory, and customer tables are browsable here.

---

### 5. **Compute**

This is where clusters, SQL warehouses, and compute resources live.

You’ll see:
- **Clusters** (for notebooks, Spark jobs, ML)
- **SQL Warehouses** (for BI + SQL dashboards)
- **Job compute** (for automated pipelines)

Your data engineer says:

> “Think of this as your engine room. Without compute, nothing runs.”

---

### 6. **Workflows**

Workflows = scheduled tasks, ETL pipelines, and automated production jobs.

Inside, you can:
- Schedule notebooks  
- Run DLT pipelines  
- Trigger jobs based on events  
- View logs and history  

ShopWave uses workflows for daily data refresh pipelines.

---

### 7. **Catalog (Unity Catalog)**

Unity Catalog is Databricks' governance layer.

Here you manage:
- Users & groups  
- Permissions  
- Table access  
- Audit logs  

ShopWave uses this to ensure:
- Analysts see only what they should  
- Sensitive PII data is protected  
- ML engineers can access feature tables  

---

### 8. **Marketplace**

The Marketplace lets you discover:
- Public datasets  
- Partner data  
- Analytics-ready data packages  

ShopWave uses Marketplace to import:
- Demographics  
- Weather data  
- Industry benchmarks  

---

### 9. **Dashboards & SQL Editor (in SQL persona view)**

SQL users switch to the **SQL UI**, which shows:
- Dashboards  
- Queries  
- Alerts  
- SQL Warehouses  

BI teams at ShopWave use this area daily for KPIs, reports, and self-service analytics.

---

## 🔍 Top Bar Overview

The top bar contains:

### 🔎 Global Search  
Find tables, notebooks, dashboards instantly.

### 🔔 Notifications  
Job failures, run results, cluster alerts.

### ⚙ Settings  
Manage:
- Personal tokens  
- Credentials  
- Workspace preferences  

### 👤 Profile  
Sign out, edit profile, manage permissions.

---

## 🗂️ What the UI Looks Like When You Work

Let’s walk through a typical ShopWave workflow:

1. A data engineer opens **Workspace → ETL Project**  
2. Launches a **Notebook**  
3. Connects to a **Cluster**  
4. Reads a Delta table from **Data**  
5. Writes results into Lakehouse  
6. Schedules the job in **Workflows**  
7. BI teams view updated KPIs in **SQL Dashboards**

All workflows start from the **same workspace UI**, making collaboration fluid.

---

## 🧠 Why the Databricks UI Matters

The UI is built for:

- **Beginners** → easy to navigate  
- **Analysts** → SQL-first experience  
- **Engineers** → notebook + clusters  
- **ML teams** → experiment tracking & model deployment  
- **Admins** → governance and monitoring  

It brings *everyone* into one consistent platform.
