# 💼 About Me

I’m **Harish C**, a data engineer dedicated to building **scalable, reliable, and future-ready data ecosystems**.

My experience spans designing and optimizing end-to-end data platforms across industries, where I focus on:

- Distributed data processing with PySpark & Spark SQL  
- Lakehouse architectures built on Databricks & Delta Lake  
- Workflow orchestration using Airflow & dbt  
- Cloud-native warehousing with Snowflake  
- Data quality, lineage, observability & cost governance  

I specialize in turning complex data systems into **high-performance, production-grade architectures** that balance speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

# 🧩 What Drives My Work

My philosophy is simple:

### **Data engineering should be an engineering discipline — not just pipeline writing.**

I believe in:

- Architecting for scale, not patching for survival  
- Designing systems with clarity and intent  
- Making performance predictable  
- Building data platforms that teams can trust  
- Creating solutions that grow with the business  

I love breaking down even the most advanced concepts into something **clear, practical, and rooted in real engineering principles**.
