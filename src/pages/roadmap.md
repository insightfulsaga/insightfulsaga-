# 🚀 Expanding the Stack

This platform is constantly evolving.

While the core tutorials currently focus on **PySpark**, **Databricks**, and **Delta Lake**, we’re actively expanding into more tools, technologies, and patterns that today’s data engineers and architects rely on daily.

### 🔧 Upcoming Topics & Tools

> **Snowflake**
> Cloud-native data warehousing designed for performance, scale, and simplicity.

> **Apache Airflow**
> Powerful workflow orchestration — enabling complex, reliable, and scheduled pipelines.

> **Scala**
> Advanced data processing and functional programming with Spark — for performance-critical jobs.

> **dbt (Data Build Tool)**
> Modular and testable SQL transformations for modern analytics workflows.

> **Cloud Platforms: AWS, GCP, Azure**
> End-to-end real-world examples for data engineering on cloud-native infrastructure.

> **Observability & Data Governance**
> Best practices in monitoring, logging, data lineage, and compliance — critical for production-grade systems.
